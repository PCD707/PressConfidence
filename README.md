Why Press Confidence? [Link to blogpost](https://medium.com/@darrenbig/global-distrust-in-the-press-a-never-before-seen-crisis-e9b604ab6bdf)

Public trust in the press is often described as “collapsing,” yet long-term data suggests the story is more complex. This project was born from a simple question: is confidence in the press really at an all-time low, or have people always been sceptical?

Using global survey data (World Values Survey, European Values Study) alongside recent trust barometers and digital news reports, I set out to:

Track long-term trends in confidence in the press across regions and age groups (1981–2025).

Visualize how patterns of trust have shifted, not only in averages but across the full spectrum of responses.

Explore why scepticism feels sharper today—highlighting the roles of information saturation, algorithm-driven news, misinformation campaigns, and the rise of personality-led media.

The aim of this project isn’t just statistical. It’s about making sense of today’s “crisis of trust” in context: showing that distrust isn’t new, but that digital-era dynamics are amplifying and accelerating how we experience it.

This repository contains the data processing scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and visualizations used to build the analysis that later shaped my long-form blog post.
